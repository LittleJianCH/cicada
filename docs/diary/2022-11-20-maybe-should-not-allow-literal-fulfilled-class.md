Currently literal fulfilled class is allowed.

But maybe all classes must be purely abstract.

- This will be a important limitation if imposed.
- This influences community coding style (naming convention).

Questions:

- For the semantic of fulfilling class,
  how are the fulfilled values
  different from provided values?
