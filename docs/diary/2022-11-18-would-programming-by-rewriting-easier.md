For example, in some case, we need a version of `readback`
without type-directed eta-expansion on object.

Would it be easy to add a new version of `readback`
if we programming by rewriting?

Because when programming by pattern matching ADT,
each case is but a rule, but we can not change just one rule.

- Is `nanopass` framework programming by rewriting?
