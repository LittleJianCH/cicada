too slow

- example:

  ```
  cic run std/boolean-lattice/BooleanLattice.md
  ```

- profile:

  ```
  0x ./bin/cic.js run std/boolean-lattice/BooleanLattice.md
  ```

# std

pass std/boolean-lattice -- maybe quit using `deepWalk`
pass std/category/initial-and-terminal-objects.md -- maybe quit using `deepWalk` can fix this
pass std/groupoid -- need `super`
pass std/order -- need datatype

# maybe

[maybe] [mimor] reading-inference-rules.mimor
[maybe] [book] the-little-typer/99-appendix-b.md -- use whereabouts syntax
[maybe] `Stmts.ClazzExtends` support `super` -- need `substExp`
