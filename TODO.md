# having solution all the time

making `Solution` should be a class -- having side-effect methods
simple `ImplicitAp` insertion on `ImplicitPi` v.s. `Ap`
evaluate also lookup `solution` -- beside `env`

applyClosure -- need solution to call `evaluate`

- maybe `evaluate` should not take `solution`，
  `solution` should be used to build new `env`。
