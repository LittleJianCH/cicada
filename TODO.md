# having solution all the time

add `solution` to `readback`

insert `ImplicitAp` during check

- add test "compute ImplicitAp -- insertion -- during check"

infer and check take `mod` instead of `solution`

every call to `evaluate` should use `solution` enriched `env`

- `Mod` should provide API for this
