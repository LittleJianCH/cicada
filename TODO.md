# std

`occur` -- should check `Value` instead of `Core` -- for partial evaluation

quit using `deepWalk` before `inclusion`

`FnImplicit` insertion -- much needed in `std/category/Category.md`

pass std/boolean-lattice
pass std/category/initial-and-terminal-objects.md -- maybe quit using `deepWalk` can fix this
pass std/groupoid -- need `super`
pass std/order -- need datatype

# maybe

[maybe] [mimor] reading-inference-rules.mimor
[maybe] [book] the-little-typer/99-appendix-b.md -- use whereabouts syntax
[maybe] `Stmts.ClazzExtends` support `super` -- need `substExp`
