# insertImplicitAp

deepWalk

add deepWalk to `Stmts.Solve`

deepWalk -- note about target of deepWalk

insertImplicitAp -- `collectPatternVars` again on `Values.ImplicitPi`

[refactor] insertImplicitAp -- improve recursion structure

- [maybe] define a `Inserting` class

[maybe] fix recursion structure of `solveType` and `solve`

- Should be able to call `solveType` as API

[maybe] insertImplicitFn -- after `foldFn`

[maybe] checkByInfer -- when inferred type is ImplicitPi, handle it specially
