`occur` -- `Cons`
`occur` -- `ClazzCons`
`occur` -- `Objekt`

`checkByInfer` -- should not use `deepWalk` before `inclusion`

- `readback` take `mod` and use `prepareValueForUnify`

`FnImplicit` insertion -- much needed in `std/category/Category.md`

# std

pass std/boolean-lattice
pass std/category/initial-and-terminal-objects.md -- maybe quit using `deepWalk` can fix this
pass std/groupoid -- need `super`
pass std/order -- need datatype

# maybe

[maybe] [mimor] reading-inference-rules.mimor
[maybe] [book] the-little-typer/99-appendix-b.md -- use whereabouts syntax
[maybe] `Stmts.ClazzExtends` support `super` -- need `substExp`
